Party Game Party - Application with 3 party games: catch phrase, pictionary, and fishbowl.
Each game is a team-based word guessing game.
Each game gets its words from an online database that is created by the app users.
To add words to the database, use the "create word database" activity from the main menu.
Catch phrase and fishbowl require only a single phone.
Pictionary requires at least two phones.
The drawings of the host are mirrored on the non-host phones.
